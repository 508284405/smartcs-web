# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create comprehensive markdown documentation of all database table structures in the SmartCS project. The documentation will serve as a knowledge base reference for AI agents to write accurate SQL statements and understand the database schema relationships.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer or AI agent, I want comprehensive database table documentation in markdown format, so that I can understand the complete database schema and write accurate SQL queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the documentation is generated THEN the system SHALL include all existing database tables from the project
2. WHEN a table is documented THEN the system SHALL include table name, description, and all column definitions
3. WHEN column information is provided THEN the system SHALL include column name, data type, constraints, default values, and comments
4. WHEN indexes exist on a table THEN the system SHALL document all indexes with their column references
5. WHEN foreign key relationships exist THEN the system SHALL document the relationships between tables

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a knowledge base administrator, I want the table documentation organized in a clear markdown structure, so that it can be easily imported into the knowledge base system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the documentation is generated THEN the system SHALL format it as valid markdown with proper headers and tables
2. WHEN multiple tables are documented THEN the system SHALL organize them with clear section separators
3. WHEN table relationships exist THEN the system SHALL include a relationships section showing foreign key connections
4. WHEN the documentation is complete THEN the system SHALL include a table of contents for easy navigation
5. WHEN column information is displayed THEN the system SHALL use markdown tables for clear formatting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want detailed column metadata and constraints information, so that I can generate SQL statements that respect data integrity rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN column constraints are documented THEN the system SHALL include PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, and NOT NULL constraints
2. WHEN default values exist THEN the system SHALL document the default value for each column
3. WHEN auto-increment columns exist THEN the system SHALL clearly mark them as auto-generated
4. WHEN column comments exist THEN the system SHALL include the business meaning of each column
5. WHEN data types are documented THEN the system SHALL include the exact MySQL data type with length specifications

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want the documentation to include table statistics and metadata, so that I can understand table usage patterns and optimization opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tables are documented THEN the system SHALL include the table engine type (InnoDB, MyISAM, etc.)
2. WHEN character sets are specified THEN the system SHALL document the table charset and collation
3. WHEN table comments exist THEN the system SHALL include the table-level comments
4. WHEN indexes are documented THEN the system SHALL specify index types (PRIMARY, UNIQUE, INDEX, FULLTEXT)
5. WHEN composite indexes exist THEN the system SHALL list all columns in the correct order

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the documentation to be automatically updatable, so that it stays synchronized with database schema changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the generation process runs THEN the system SHALL scan all SQL files in the project
2. WHEN new tables are added THEN the system SHALL include them in the updated documentation
3. WHEN table structures change THEN the system SHALL reflect the latest schema definitions
4. WHEN the documentation is regenerated THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent formatting and structure
5. WHEN SQL files contain CREATE TABLE statements THEN the system SHALL parse and extract all table definitions
